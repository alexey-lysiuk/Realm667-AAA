## Realm667 - An Awesome Awesomeness
##### Weapons/monsters/powerups collection for (G)ZDoom
#### About

This project is an attempt to _automatically_ combine all assets from www.realm667.com repository in a single package.  
Check `issues.md` file for the list of known issues.

#### How to build

You need Python 2.7 to run `build.py` script. It will create `realm667-aaa.pk3` in the repository's root directory.  
The script will download and cache all resources during the first run. Generation process will be much faster next time.

#### How to play

Load `realm667-aaa.pk3` in the recent development build of (G)ZDoom.  
Open **Realm667 - Armory** menu ('H' button by default) to summon weapons.  
Open **Realm667 - Beastiary** menu ('J' button by default) to summon monsters. Here you can change your affiliation with monsters.  
Open **Realm667 - Item Store** menu ('N' button by default) to summon power-up, keys and other inventory items.  
Use 'U' button (by default) to summon the last summoned actor again.
The key bindings can be changed in **Customize Controls** menu. Look for **Realm667 - An Awesome Awesomeness** at the bottom of the controls list.
