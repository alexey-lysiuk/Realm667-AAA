#### About

Attempt to _automatically_ combine all assets from www.realm667.com repository in a single package.  
Check `issues.md` file for the list of known issues.

#### How to build

You need Python 2.7 to run `build.py` script. It will create `realm667-aaa.pk3` in the repository's root directory.
