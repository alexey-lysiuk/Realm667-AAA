## Realm667 - An Awesome Awesomeness

#### About

Attempt to _automatically_ combine all assets from www.realm667.com repository in a single package.  
Check ```issues.md``` file for the list of known issues.

#### How to build

You need Python 2.7 to run ```build.py``` script. It will create ```realm667-aaa.pk3``` in the repository's root directory.  
The script will download and cache all resources during the first run. Generation process will be much faster next time.
